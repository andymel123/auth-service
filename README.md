# auth-service
OAuth2 in -> JWT out 

!(not working yet)!

What I want
- If a user wants to do things that need authorization he will retrieve a JWT from this service
- authentication will be delegated to google,facebook,...

For now it is basically just copiing together from
https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-boot-oauth2/ for the OAuth part
http://www.svlada.com/jwt-token-authentication-with-spring-boot/#ajax-authentication for the JWT part
